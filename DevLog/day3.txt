STarted planning for task 2. found a sample script on geek for geeks,
for speech recognition library. The code works without problem.
task 2 is complete, but it felt too easy, so will make it more impressive later.
for now will work on task 4.
reason for not working on task 3 is because i have no idea how to do it,
and how it works, while task4 is easy and i have done it mutiple times.

My approach is to use langchain and google gemini with continuos chat.
added library python-dotenv to read the ENV files
used the google 2.5 flash, and task 4 has been completed.
