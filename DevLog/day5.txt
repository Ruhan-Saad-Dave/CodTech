Instead of doing the heavy documentation, i have decided to improve the tasks quality,
making it more impressive.
For task 1, the first plan is to use gradio for the user interface.
The plan is to make a chatbot type interface, so the history is saved.
after the gradio part is done, i can work on making a system that will read files and
summaries it. for that need to implement a feature for drag and drop,
after that the system should be able to retrieve the text and then summaries it.
Doing these advanced stuff shoud make it look good enough.

[Docs] Gradio is a python library that is used for make a very simple user interface in the for of a website.
Commonly used by data scientists or AI engineer to display the results.
For this task will use the ChatInterface class, which as the name suggests creates an interface,
specially used with chatbots. It takes in a function which accepts user input everytime the user press enter
and displays the returned message from the function.
ChatInterface class has a multimodal feature that can accept files.
For reading the pdf file, will use the PyMuPDF library. When multimodal mode of the chatinterface is activated
instead of a string, it gives a dictionary with keys "text" and "files".
using these we can put a condition block for checking for plain text or uploaded files. 
There is different file reading techniques depending on the file extension.
The system extracts the text and then pass it to the pipeline function for summarization.

Task1 has been successfully massively improved.
