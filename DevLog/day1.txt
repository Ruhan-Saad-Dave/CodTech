This is the 1st day of my internship. I have received my tasks and set up my development environment.
No meetings have taken place; only the tasks were assigned. The 1st task is a Text Summarization tool.
From previous experience, I know Hugging Face has a `pipeline()` function that can summarize text, so that will be the first plan of action. I will focus on creating a good display in the command line.

To improve it further, I could look into using pure NLTK for summarization, but it is not as efficient. Other features that can be added are reading from a file (text or PDF) and summarizing the content. A third feature could be implementing a proper UI using Gradio.

Task 2 is a Speech Recognition System. I will use Gradio for the UI, where the user can either record their voice directly or upload an audio file. While the SpeechRecognition library is easy to implement, I need to research choices for multilingual support.

Task 3 is Neural Style Transfer. From what I understand, it requires two images: one for content and the other for style. The goal is to convert the content image into the given style. I will need to do more research on this.

Task 4 is a Generative Text Model. The plan is to use Gradio, LangChain, and Google Gemini, and also provide a feature for maintaining conversation history.

For today, all the planning is done, along with the installation of potential dependencies.

Libraries to be used:
- uv
- gradio
- transformers
- torch
- PyMuPDF
- SpeechRecognition
- openai-whisper
- langchain
- langchain-google-genai
