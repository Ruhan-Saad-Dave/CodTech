This is the 1st day when i have received my tasks and also started my internship. 
No meeting has taken place, only tasks are given. The 1st task is a Text summarization tool.
From previous experience, Hugging Face has a function "pipeline" which is able to summaries the text,
so that will the first plan of action. Just need to make a good display in the CMD and the task will be done.
If wanted to improve further, can look into using pure NLTK for summarization, 
but it is not efficient. Other feature that can be added is to read a file (text or pdf) 
and summaries from that. The 3rd feature that can be implemented i using Gradio for a proper
UI.

Task 2 is Speech recognition system. Will use gradio for UI, where the user can either
directly record a voice, or drag and drop one. while Speech recognition library is easy to implemented
need to check for choices of multiligual. can also implement text to speech but it isn't worth
since takes too much processing power.

task 3 is Natural Style Transfer. From what I understood, need 2 images: 1 for style
other for context. need to convert the context image into the given style. Need to
make research on it. 

Task 4 is Generative text model. Just need to use gradio, langchain and google gemini,
and also provide the feature of maintaining conversation.

For today, all the planning is done, along with the installation of potential dependencies.

Libraries added and to be used:
- uv 
- gradio 
- transformers 
- pyaudio 
- speechrecognition 
- langchain 
- langchain-google-genai
