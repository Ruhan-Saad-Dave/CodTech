Now it's time to massively improve Task 2.
First step is to build a gradio interface. The components that will be needed is an audio section, 
a text section to display the text, and a button to upload audio files.
While Speechrecognition library is very good for speech to text, we can also use the pre trained model
OpenAI Whisper, but it will take lots of processing power, only advantage is that it makes it multi lingual.
So in the gradio interface will make 2 sections, one for normal english and other for foreign languages

after carefull consideration, the plan of using openai whisper has been dropped, because it wont be
worth it.

Also improved Task 4 to use gradio as user interface, and in task 3 too, where the user can drop the image
and get the generated content.
