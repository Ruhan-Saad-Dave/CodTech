This is the day I officially started working on Task 1: Text summarization tool.

My approach is to make a simple CMD client that asks user for text, and simply summaries it
using hugging face built in functions.
Discovered to run the pipeline function, need pytorch library
for the pre trained model, decided to use facebook/bert-base

Took a lot of time to run the code on laptop, so used google collab extension,
Discovered that the input field comes on the top of the window in the search bar which is weird.
but regardless, the code is working and can be said task 1 is done.
