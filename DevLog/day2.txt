Today I officially started working on Task 1: Text Summarization Tool.

My approach is to make a simple command-line client that asks the user for text and summarizes it using a Hugging Face pipeline.
I discovered that I need the PyTorch library to run the pipeline function. For the pre-trained model, I decided to start with `facebook/bart-large-cnn`.

It took a lot of time to run the code on my laptop, so I used the Google Colab extension in VSCode. I noticed that the input field appears at the top of the window in the search bar, which is an odd UI behavior but doesn't break functionality.

Regardless, the code is working, and the basic requirements for Task 1 are complete.
