STarted working on the final task.
installed dependencies tensorflow, tensorflow_hub and matplotlib
the plan is to use one of the pretrained model on tensorflow hub to copy the image style onto the content.

using google collab since laptop processing speed slow. 
discovered that collab extension cannot read images, and need to find a new way.
Model is able to generate the image, and hence task 3 is complete.

All the task for submission of the internship has been completed.
The next steps can be to document the stuff that i already know,
also can improve more on the task to make them look more good.
